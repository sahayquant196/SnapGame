# SnapGame
Python based implementation of the card game Snap
The "Snap!" matching condition can be the face value of the card, the suit, or both. The program asks:
(i) How many packs to use (i.e. define N)
(ii) Which of the three matching conditions to use (suit, value, suit or value)

When two matching cards are played sequentially, a player is chosen randomly as having declared "Snap!" first and takes ownership of all cards played in that run. Play continues until the common draw pile is completely exhausted (any cards played without ending in a "Snap!" at the time the draw pile is exhausted are ignored).
